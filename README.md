# Parent and Snap Tool

This tool can automatically parent an child to another object while also modifying the transforms to allow for easier posing!

# How to install:

There are two methods to install, method one is highly recommended.

## Method 1:
Open "ParentingTool.py" in Maya's script editor, then either run it or select the text and drag it to the shelf. Dragging to the shelf is recommended for convenience.

## Method 2:
Drag the install.mel file into the viewport. This will make a button on the current shelf, though even after much troubleshooting, this seems to only work once per session. In other words, you must either leave the window open or reopen Maya each time you want to use the tool using this installation method.

# The Tool Itself Can:

* Parent several objects to a single parent while moving all of their transforms to match the parent.
* Works in a single button click.
* Ideal for weapon props in hands, or any other kind of character interaction animation.
